Hello Amanda,<br></br>
  
We noticed that you haven’t filled out the survey we sent last Tuesday, January 21, 2020. 

As you know, the survey is a group survey. We can’t let your group continue with the session if yours is not submitted. The survey is very important. It indicates how much your group had learned in the last session. It also helps us design the class activity for the next session. 

You need you to **submit your survey within 24 hours** from this notice. Otherwise, we cannot let your group attend the next session. Please let us know as soon as you submit your answer to the survey. <br></br>

All the best,
Samantha Taylor,
CodePath, Assistant Professor
